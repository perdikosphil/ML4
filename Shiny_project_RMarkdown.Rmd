## Project Goal

This peer assessed assignment has two parts.

 First,  create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers.
 
 Second, use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about your application.

## Steps to Perform

1. Write a shiny application with associated supporting documentation. The documentation should be thought of as whatever a user will need to get started using your application.
2. Deploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server
3. Share the application link by pasting it into the provided text box
4. Share your server.R and ui.R code on github

## How to use the application

It is a simple application where you can choose the parameter (fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance) of the car which would display a comparison chart across 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models) for data extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine.


## Shiny Application File - UI.R

library(shiny)
library(datasets)
Car_dataset <- datasets::mtcars

fluidPage(     
  titlePanel("Motor trend car road tests"), 
  sidebarLayout(       
    sidebarPanel(p(strong("Source:",style="color:red"), a("mtcars",href="https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/mtcars.html")), 
                 selectInput("Param", "Parameter:",
                             choices=colnames(Car_dataset))
    ), 
    mainPanel( 
      plotOutput("car")   
    ) 
  ) 
) 

## Shiny Application File - Server.R

library(shiny)
library(datasets)
Car_dataset <- datasets::mtcars

function(input, output) { 
  
  series <- rownames(Car_dataset)
  Title <- c("Miles/(US) gallon",
             "Number of cylinders",
             "Displacement (cu.in.)",
             "Gross horsepower",
             "Rear axle ratio",
             "Weight (1000 lbs)",
             "1/4 mile time",
             "Engine (0 = V-shaped, 1 = straight)",
             "Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)",
             "Number of forward gears",
             "Number of carburetors"
  )
  
  output$car <- renderPlot({ 
    par(mar=c(10, 4.1, 4.1, 2.1))
    barplot(Car_dataset[,input$Param],names.arg = c(series),
            las=3,cex.axis=1, cex.names=1,
            main=Title[grep(input$Param, colnames(Car_dataset))],
            ylab=input$Param)
  })
}

## Shiny Application File - URL

The application is running [here](https://azcb0m-nikhil-agrawal.shinyapps.io/project/).

The ui.R and Server.R code are in my [github repository](https://github.com/nikhilagrl18/ML_assignment/tree/Shiny-Application-and-Reproducible-Pitch).
